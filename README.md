# ESP-LEGO-SPIKE-Simulator
 LEGO SPIKE is a great educational system for kids to learn the secrets of programming and robot building. The shortcoming of the system is that the program code cannot be tested conveniently. In order to test the written code, it is always necessary to build the complete LEGO hardware. This is what the ESP LEGO SPIKE simulator is trying to help with. The code written in the LEGO SPIKE environment can be loaded onto an ESP-type microcontroller without modification. And without having a single sensor or motor (peripherals) you can run the LEGO SPIKE code. The simulated peripherals can be preset freely in the program, or even changed in run-time using the console. Real peripherals can also be connected to the ESP microcontroller so that you can try out the program in real life.
